## Where We Left Off

In our last session, you learned the **4-part framework** for making a good point:

::: {.incremental}
- **The Point** --- lead with your claim
- **Why It's True** --- the reasoning
- **The Evidence** --- Zoom In (deduction) and Zoom Out (induction)
- **Who Cares** --- the impact
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-box}
Today we go deeper into one specific skill --- the one that separates solid recommendations from shaky ones, especially when working in contexts like Ethiopia.

**Today's question: When you claim X causes Y, how do you prove it?**
:::


## Why Causal Arguments Matter

In Ethiopia, causal claims come up every day in MNH work:

::: {.incremental}
- A consultant tells an Ethiopian minister: *"The vacancy rate at health posts is causing preventable newborn deaths."*
- A report states: *"Community Health Extension Workers improved antenatal care coverage by 18% in Ethiopia."*
- A donor asks: *"How do you know this program in Ethiopia caused the improvement?"*
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-box .orange}
Each of these is a **causal claim**. And every one of them can be challenged.
:::


# The Core Problem {background-color="#005CB9"}

[Correlation Is Not Causation]{style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:300;"}


## Correlation vs. Causation

::: {.columns-equal}
::: {.col}
::: {.example-block}
[Correlation]{.example-label}

In Ethiopia, woredas with more Community Health Extension Workers tend to have lower maternal mortality.

The two **move together**.
:::
:::

::: {.col}
::: {.example-block}
[Causation]{.example-label}

Deploying CHEWs to underserved woredas in Ethiopia **caused** maternal mortality to decline.

One **produced** the other.
:::
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.key-takeaway}
**Correlation tells you two things move together. Causation tells you one made the other happen.**

Stakeholders in Ethiopia need to know which claim is being made.
:::


## The Timeline Trap

The most common causal mistake:

### **Because X happened before Y, X must have caused Y.**

::: {.incremental}
- A CHEW training program launched in Ethiopia in January
- Neonatal mortality dropped by March
- Therefore the program caused the drop. Right?
- **Not necessarily. Timing alone is not proof.**
:::

. . .

::: {.example-block}
[Example]{.example-label}

A new CHEW training program was rolled out in Ethiopia's Tigray region in Q1. Neonatal mortality dropped 12% by Q3. But Ethiopia's national bed-net distribution campaign also ran during the same period.

Did the training cause the drop --- or did fewer malaria-related neonatal deaths?

## [<span class="step-number red">1</span> Common Cause]{style="font-size:0.95em;"}

Could a **third factor** be causing both X and Y?

::: {.incremental}
- In Ethiopia, we can observe: woredas with more NGO programs also have better MNH outcomes
- But both might be driven by a third factor: **government prioritization under Ethiopia's HSTP**
- High-priority woredas in Ethiopia attract more NGOs *and* receive more government investment
:::

. . .

::: {.example-block}
[Example]{.example-label}

**Your claim:** "Our safe delivery kit deployment reduced obstetric complications in Ethiopia."

**The challenge:** The health centers in Ethiopia chosen for deployment were already higher-performing because they had stronger woreda health office leadership --- the common cause.
:::


## [<span class="step-number orange">2</span> Coincidence]{style="font-size:0.95em;"}

Could X and Y just **happen to move together** without any real connection?

::: {.incremental}
- The more data points tracked across Ethiopia, the more spurious correlations emerge
- Especially in small samples (a single health center, one quarter of data)
- Ask yourself: is there a plausible *mechanism* connecting X and Y?
:::

. . .

::: {.example-block}
[Example]{.example-label}

A health center in Ethiopia's SNNPR introduced a new patient register the same month neonatal mortality dropped. Did the register cause the drop?

More likely: the drop was within normal quarterly variation. **No mechanism connects a register format to newborn survival.**
:::


## [<span class="step-number teal">3</span> Reversed Causation]{style="font-size:0.95em;"}

Could the **direction of causation be backwards?**

::: {.incremental}
- Consider this from Ethiopia: health posts with more supportive supervision visits have better outcomes
- But maybe better-performing health posts *attract* more visits
- The outcome might be driving the input, not the other way around
:::

. . .

::: {.example-block}
[Example]{.example-label}

**Your claim:** "More frequent supportive supervision visits improved health post performance in Ethiopia's Oromia region."

**The challenge:** Maybe supervisors visit high-performing health posts in Ethiopia more often because they are easier to reach and more cooperative. The performance is driving the visits --- not the reverse.
:::


## The Checklist

Before claiming X caused Y in Ethiopia, run through these three checks:

| Challenge | The Question | In Ethiopia's Health System |
|---|---|---|
| **Common Cause** | Could something else cause both? | Check for confounders --- Ethiopia's HSTP priority status, geography, baseline capacity, donor attention |
| **Coincidence** | Is the connection real or noise? | Look for a plausible mechanism. Check sample sizes across Ethiopian woredas. Is this within normal variation? |
| **Reversed Causation** | Is the direction backwards? | Could the outcome be driving the input? Watch for selection effects in Ethiopia's health system |


# Building a Causal Argument {background-color="#005CB9"}

[From claim to conviction]{style="font-size:1.3em; font-weight:300;"}


## The Two-Part Structure

A solid causal argument has **two parts**:

::: {.incremental}
- [1]{.step-number} **Show the correlation** --- X and Y move together (use data from Ethiopia)
- [2]{.step-number .green} **Tell the causal story** --- explain *how* X produces Y (the mechanism)
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-box .green}
**The causal story is what separates a correlation from a cause.** It is a chain of reasoning that explains the steps between X and Y.
:::

Remember **"Why It's True"** from the Anatomy framework? The causal story *is* your "why it's true" for causal claims.


## What Makes a Good Causal Story

::: {.columns-equal}
::: {.col}
::: {.example-block}
[Bad]{.example-label .bad-example}

"We deployed CHEWs in Ethiopia and maternal mortality dropped."

*Correlation only. No mechanism.*
:::
:::

::: {.col}
::: {.example-block}
[Good]{.example-label .good-example}

"Ethiopia's CHEWs conducted home visits &rarr; identified danger signs early &rarr; referred mothers to health centers faster &rarr; reduced the first and second delays in emergency obstetric care &rarr; reduced maternal hemorrhage deaths."

*Chain of mechanism.*
:::
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-box}
A good causal story traces the **chain of events** step by step. Each link should be plausible and, ideally, supported by evidence.
:::


## The Removal Test

The strongest test of causation: **if you removed X, would Y still happen?**

::: {.incremental}
- If you pulled Ethiopia's CHEWs out, would the improvements vanish?
- If you stopped the mentorship program in Ethiopia, would facility performance decline?
- If yes --- you have strong evidence of causation
:::

. . .

::: {.example-block}
[Example]{.example-label}

We paused the essential medicine supply chain reform for one quarter in control woredas in Ethiopia. Stockout rates climbed back to baseline. We reinstated it. Stockouts dropped again.

**That is evidence of causation --- not just correlation.**
:::

[<span class="step-number" style="width:36px;height:36px;font-size:0.55em;">1</span> **The Claim:**]{style="color:#005CB9; font-weight:600;"} "Our mentorship program reduced neonatal mortality in target health centers in Ethiopia's Amhara region."

[<span class="step-number green" style="width:36px;height:36px;font-size:0.55em;">2</span> **The Correlation:**]{style="color:#3E9B6E; font-weight:600;"} "Health centers in Ethiopia with mentored midwives saw a 35% drop in neonatal deaths over 12 months; matched control facilities saw no change."

[<span class="step-number teal" style="width:36px;height:36px;font-size:0.55em;">3</span> **The Causal Story:**]{style="color:#3E9B6E; font-weight:600;"} "Mentored midwives in Ethiopia learned neonatal resuscitation skills, applied them in delivery rooms, recognized danger signs earlier, and initiated treatment faster."

[<span class="step-number red" style="width:36px;height:36px;font-size:0.55em;">4</span> **Ruling Out Alternatives:**]{style="color:#E24A3F; font-weight:600;"} "Not common cause (control facilities in Ethiopia had similar baseline resources). Not coincidence (35% drop is well beyond normal quarterly variation). Not reversed causation (facilities were randomly assigned, not self-selected)."

[<span class="step-number orange" style="width:36px;height:36px;font-size:0.55em;">5</span> **The Removal Test:**]{style="color:#FA7650; font-weight:600;"} "When mentors rotated out of two Ethiopian facilities temporarily, neonatal resuscitation rates dropped within weeks."

:::


## Common Mistakes

::: {.incremental style="font-size:0.85em;"}
- **Confusing correlation with causation** --- "The data from Ethiopia shows X and Y are linked" is not the same as "X caused Y"
- **Relying on timing alone** --- "It happened after our program launched in Ethiopia" is the timeline trap
- **Ignoring common causes** --- The most frequent failure in program evaluation in Ethiopia and globally
- **Skipping the causal story** --- If you can't explain *how* X causes Y step by step, neither can your audience
- **Overclaiming from small samples** --- One health center in Ethiopia, one quarter of data is not enough to establish a pattern
:::


## Calibrate Your Language

Match your claim to the strength of your evidence:

| Evidence Strength | Appropriate Language |
|---|---|
| Strong RCT or quasi-experimental design | "X caused Y" |
| Consistent correlation + plausible mechanism | "X likely contributed to Y" |
| Observed correlation, mechanism unclear | "X is associated with Y" |
| Single case, limited data | "X may have played a role in Y" |
| No mechanism, timing only | "We observed Y after X, but cannot yet attribute causation" |

. . .

::: {.callout-box}
**Calibrate your language.** Stakeholders in Ethiopia and beyond respect precision. Overclaiming destroys credibility.
:::


## Key Takeaways

::: {.incremental}
1. **Correlation is not causation** --- showing X and Y move together is step one, not the finish line
2. **Rule out the three alternatives** --- common cause, coincidence, reversed causation
3. **Tell the causal story** --- trace the mechanism step by step
4. **Apply the removal test** --- if X disappears, does Y?
5. **Calibrate your claim** --- match your language to your evidence
:::

. . .

::: {.key-takeaway}
**A causal argument that holds up does three things: shows the pattern, explains the mechanism, and rules out the alternatives.**
